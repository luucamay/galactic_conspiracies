# Galactic Conspiracies

**AI-powered interactive radio where listeners shape the broadcast through micropayments.**

Galactic Conspiracies transforms passive audio consumption into an interactive experience. AI hosts run continuous live broadcasts that depend entirely on listener engagement to survive. When the "Signal Stability" countdown hits zero, the station goes dark.

## Core Concept

Each station features an AI agent broadcasting live with a synthetic voice. Listeners can:

- **Fuel ($0.10)** — Extend the broadcast by 5 minutes
- **Inject ($1)** — Feed secret information into the AI's narrative
- **Call ($10)** — Go live on-air for a 1-minute voice conversation with the AI host
- **Claim ($10)** — Own and share the last 30 seconds of lore as a social media card

Every payment triggers an immediate on-air acknowledgment, creating a direct feedback loop between listener action and broadcast response.

## The Experience

Listeners browse a feed of active stations, each showing its host, current topic, listener count, and remaining signal time. Tapping in unmutes the live stream. As signal stability drops, urgency builds—red warnings, flashing borders, and the AI's tone shifts. Pay to keep it alive, or watch it fade to static.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Z.AI** for generating station concepts and broadcast content
- **ElevenLabs** for real-time AI voice synthesis
- **Tether WDK** for non-custodial smart contract wallet deployment
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with Motion (Framer Motion) for animations
- Mobile-first 9:16 interface design

## AI Integration

### Z.AI

Uses Z.AI chat completions for two purposes:

1. **Station Generation** — When a user enters a lore prompt, Z.AI generates 4 AI whistleblower personas as structured JSON:
   - `agentName`: cryptic hacker-style identities
   - `visualPrompt`: image generation prompts
   - `shortLore`: 1-sentence broadcast summaries

2. **Live Broadcast Script** — Streaming chat completion generates broadcast text. The AI plays a "pirate radio host" role with short, conspiratorial sentences. Handles:
   - Opening transmissions with cryptic greetings
   - Continuation segments referencing prior content
   - **Injection acknowledgments** — when listeners pay to inject info, the AI thanks them by name and weaves their intel into the narrative

### ElevenLabs

Uses the `eleven_turbo_v2_5` model via `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js` SDK for text-to-speech:

- **Output**: MP3 at 44.1kHz/128kbps
- **Parallel generation**: Text is split into sentences, audio generated concurrently via `Promise.all`
- **Low-latency streaming**: Uses `optimizeStreamingLatency: 3` for real-time response

**Pipeline**: Z.AI generates text → sentences extracted → ElevenLabs generates audio in parallel → combined audio buffer returned to client.

## Wallet Integration

### Tether WDK (Wallet Development Kit)

The Tether WDK is used for **non-custodial smart contract wallet deployment** via ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction):

**Location**: [app/api/wallet/deploy/route.ts](app/api/wallet/deploy/route.ts)

**What it does:**
- Generates a random seed phrase for each request
- Creates an EVM smart contract wallet (SCW) on Sepolia testnet
- Uses `@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm-erc-4337` module for ERC-4337 support
- Returns the wallet address as JSON

**Configuration:**
- **Chain**: Sepolia testnet (chainId: 11155111)
- **Bundler**: Candide-sponsored bundler service
- **EntryPoint**: ERC-4337 entry point contract
- **Paymaster**: Candide paymaster for sponsored gas transactions

**Use case**: Enables streamlined wallet creation for listeners to receive payments from the platform. The endpoint can be called to provision a new account abstraction wallet without requiring users to manage private keys directly.
