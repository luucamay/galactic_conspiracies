# UX Specification: Galactic Conspiracies

---

## Pass 1: Mental Model

**Primary user intent:** "I want to listen to a fake radio conspiracy and interactive, and feel like I can influence what happens."

**Likely misconceptions:**

1. **"This is a normal podcast"** — Users may expect passive consumption and be confused when the stream dies without payments
2. **"My payment is a tip/donation"** — Users may not understand payments have *immediate mechanical effects* (extending time, injecting data)
3. **"The countdown is fake urgency"** — Users may not believe the broadcast actually ends at 0:00 until they see it happen
4. **"I need an account to listen"** — Users may expect login walls before audio access
5. **"Call means text chat"** — Users may not realize CALL is literal voice on-air

**UX principle to reinforce/correct:**
- **Cause and effect must be visceral and immediate.** Every payment must produce visible + audible change within 1 second. The Signal Stability bar is the heartbeat of the experience—it must feel alive and reactive.
- **No walls before the hook.** Audio plays first; payment comes after engagement.

---

## Pass 2: Information Architecture

**All user-visible concepts:**

- Station (AI radio channel)
- Station image (host avatar)
- Station title
- Station description
- Signal Stability (countdown timer)
- Listener count
- Waveform visualization
- FUEL action ($0.1, +5 min)
- INJECT action ($1.00, add lore data)
- CALL action ($10.00, 1 min live voice)
- CLAIM action ($10.00, capture lore fragment)
- Username
- Payment modal
- Lore Fragment (shareable card)
- Static event (broadcast death)
- Toast notifications
- AI acknowledgment (audible response)

**Grouped structure:**

### Station Discovery (Home Feed)
| Concept | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Station cards | Primary | Entry point; must be immediately scannable |
| Station image | Primary | Visual identity, first hook |
| Station title | Primary | Quick identification |
| Signal Stability | Primary | Creates urgency, key differentiator |
| Listener count | Secondary | Social proof, but not core mechanic |
| Station description | Secondary | Only needed if user hesitates |
| Waveform overlay | Secondary | Indicates "live" but decorative |

### Active Listening (Station View)
| Concept | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Signal Stability bar | Primary | The survival mechanic—always visible |
| Audio stream | Primary | Core experience |
| Action buttons (FUEL/INJECT/CALL/CLAIM) | Primary | Monetization + interaction |
| Waveform visualization | Secondary | Ambiance, reinforces "live" |
| Station image | Secondary | Already seen; now background |
| Listener count | Secondary | Less relevant once engaged |

### Payment Flow
| Concept | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Action button | Primary | Clear affordance |
| Payment modal | Primary | One-tap completion |
| Username input | Primary | Required for personalized acknowledgment |
| Price display | Primary | No surprises |
| Confirmation feedback | Primary | Must be instant |

### Claim Experience
| Concept | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Claim preview modal | Primary | User must see what they're buying |
| Lore Fragment card | Primary | The deliverable |
| Share buttons | Primary | Core value = social sharing |
| AI acknowledgment | Primary | Validates the purchase |

---

## Pass 3: Affordances

| Action | Visual/Interaction Signal |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Listen to station** | "LISTEN" button on card; card itself is tappable |
| **Mute/unmute** | Tap anywhere on 9:16 view toggles audio state |
| **Fuel the signal** | Red battery icon + "FUEL" label + price; glowing/pulsing when critical |
| **Inject data** | Syringe icon + "INJECT" label + price; text input appears on tap |
| **Call the host** | Telephone icon + "CALL" label + price; warning modal confirms intent |
| **Claim lore** | Flag/stamp icon + "CLAIM" label + price; preview modal shows transcript |
| **Share lore fragment** | Platform icons (X, Instagram, link) on share card |
| **Dismiss modals** | X button or tap outside; standard mobile patterns |
| **Scroll feed** | Vertical swipe; cards snap to 9:16 viewport |

**Affordance rules:**
- If it has an icon + label + price, it's a payment action
- If it's glowing/pulsing, it's urgent or recommended
- If the Signal bar is red, the FUEL button should pulse
- Read-only information (countdown, listener count) has no interactive styling
- Buttons are pill-shaped with clear tap targets (min 44px)
- The countdown timer is NOT tappable (common misconception)

---

## Pass 4: Cognitive Load

**Friction points:**

| Moment | Type | Simplification |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Choosing a station | Choice | Sort by Signal Stability (most urgent first) or listener count; no filtering needed for demo |
| First payment | Uncertainty | Pre-fill username as "Anonymous"; one-tap payment; no account required |
| Understanding FUEL effect | Uncertainty | Show "+5:00" preview on button; animate timer jump immediately |
| Writing INJECT data | Choice + Uncertainty | Provide placeholder example: "e.g., 'A plane transporting money crashed...'"; 100 char limit visible |
| Deciding to CALL | Uncertainty + Fear | Warning modal explains exactly what happens; countdown shows 1:00 duration |
| Understanding CLAIM value | Uncertainty | Preview shows exact transcript they're buying; show share mockup |
| Multiple action buttons | Choice | Visual hierarchy: FUEL largest (most common), others secondary |
| When to act | Uncertainty | Color-coded Signal bar creates urgency without explicit "act now" text |

**Defaults introduced:**

| Default | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Username = "Anonymous" | Removes friction; most users won't personalize |
| FUEL amount = $0.10 | Low default encourages trial; slider for more |
| INJECT new information text prompt | Guides user on what to contribute; reduces blank page anxiety |
| CALL starts immediately after payment, show left interaction time | No "ready?" confirmation; warning was enough |
| CLAIM preview auto-plays last 30s audio | User hears what they're buying |

---

## Pass 5: State Design

### Home Feed (Station Discovery)

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Empty | "No stations live" message + illustration | Nothing is broadcasting right now | Wait or check back later |
| Loading | 4 skeleton cards with pulsing waveforms | Feed is loading | Wait (brief) |
| Success | 4 station cards with live data | Stations are available to join | Tap any card to listen |
| Partial | 2-3 cards + "More stations coming soon" | Some content available | Browse available stations |
| Error | "Can't load stations" + retry button | Network/server issue | Tap retry |

### Station Card (Feed Item)

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Stable (>3 min) | Green Signal bar, calm waveform | Station is healthy | Listen casually |
| Warning (1-3 min) | Yellow Signal bar, pulsing overlay | Station needs help soon | Listen, consider FUEL |
| Critical (<1 min) | Red Signal bar, flashing border | Station dying, act now | FUEL urgently |
| Static (0:00) | Black & white static, "SIGNAL LOST" | Broadcast ended | Cannot interact; find another station |

### Active Station View (9:16 Full Screen)

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Loading | Skeleton with connecting animation | Joining stream | Wait |
| Live - Stable | Host image, green bar, waveform reacting to audio | Everything working | Listen, interact when ready |
| Live - Critical | Red bar, urgent waveform, FUEL button pulsing | Needs immediate help | FUEL, or watch it die |
| In Call | "ON AIR" badge, caller waveform overlay | Someone is talking to host | Listen; cannot CALL (queued) |
| Static Event | Full-screen static, white noise audio, "SIGNAL LOST" overlay | Broadcast is dead | Return to feed or wait for resurrection |

### Payment Modal

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Open | Price, username field, one-tap buttons (Apple Pay, etc.) | Ready to pay | Enter username, tap payment method |
| Processing | Spinner on payment button | Payment in progress | Wait |
| Success | Modal closes, toast "Payment received!", audio acknowledgment | It worked | Continue listening |
| Error | Toast "Payment failed. Try again." | Something went wrong | Tap button again |

### INJECT Flow

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Input | Text field with placeholder | Type your secret | Type, submit |
| Uploading | "Data uploading" glitch animation (3s) | System processing | Wait, watch the cool effect |
| Acknowledged | AI speaks the injection, toast confirms | My data is now part of the lore | Continue listening |

### CALL Flow

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Warning | Modal: "You're about to go live. 1 minute." | This is serious | Confirm or cancel |
| Connecting | "Connecting to frequency..." + mic permission prompt | Getting ready | Grant mic access |
| On Air | "ON AIR" badge, 1:00 countdown, your waveform shown | I'm live | Speak |
| Fading (0:10) | Beep sounds, countdown flashing | Time's almost up | Wrap up |
| Ended | Toast "Call ended", AI thanks you | Done | Resume listening |

### CLAIM Flow

| State | User Sees | User Understands | User Can Do |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Preview | Modal with last 30s transcript + waveform + audio preview | This is what I'm claiming | Play preview, confirm, or cancel |
| Processing | "Minting your lore fragment..." | System creating asset | Wait |
| Complete | Shareable card with image, audio, transcript, share buttons | I own this | Share to X, IG, copy link |
| Shared | Toast "Shared to X!" or "Link copied!" | Action complete | Dismiss, continue listening |

---

## Pass 6: Flow Integrity

**Flow risks:**

| Risk | Where | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| User doesn't understand Signal Stability | First station view | Tooltip on first visit: "Fuel keeps the signal alive" |
| User expects free listening indefinitely | Any station | Let them experience a Static event once—it teaches the mechanic |
| CALL mic permission denied | CALL flow | Graceful fallback: "Enable mic to go on air" + settings link; refund if not granted |
| INJECT data is inappropriate | INJECT flow | Disclaimer: "Content is public and AI-moderated" (demo: just let it through) |
| User taps CLAIM but doesn't understand value | CLAIM preview | Preview modal auto-plays audio; shows share mockup |
| Multiple users CALL simultaneously | CALL flow | Queue system: "You're #2 in line" (or for demo: lock button while someone is on air) |
| User doesn't notice AI acknowledgment | After any payment | Toast notification + visual flash + audio acknowledgment triple-reinforcement |
| User leaves before Static event | Passive listening | Push notification (if enabled): "[Station] is dying! 30 seconds left" (out of scope for demo) |

**Visibility decisions:**

**Must be visible (always):**
- Signal Stability countdown (the core mechanic)
- Current station title/host
- All 4 action buttons (FUEL, INJECT, CALL, CLAIM)
- Waveform (indicates "live")
- Listener count (shown on info tap)

**Can be implied or progressive:**
- Payment history (not shown in demo)
- Detailed station description (only on tap)

**UX constraints for visual phase:**
- **9:16 mobile-first viewport** — all core interactions must fit in thumb reach zone
- **One-handed operation** — action buttons in bottom third of screen
- **No scroll required for core actions** — FUEL/INJECT/CALL/CLAIM always visible
- **High contrast Signal bar** — must be readable in bright sunlight
- **Audio-first design** — audio starts before any visual complexity loads
- **3-second rule** — if a state lasts >3 seconds without feedback, something is wrong

## Visual Specifications

### Aesthetic Direction: "Military Leak Terminal"

**Core Concept:** A classified government frequency interceptor interface. Think leaked NSA listening station software meets dark web whistleblower portal. The UI feels like you're accessing something you shouldn't—raw, functional, slightly unstable.

**Style Pillars:**

1. **HUD / Sci-Fi FUI**
   - Thin 1px lines, beveled corners (not rounded)
   - Monospace everything—data feels like intercepted transmissions
   - Coordinate-style metadata: `FREQ: 104.9 // STATUS: DEGRADING // LAT: -82.8628`
   - Bracketed labels: `[ FUEL ]` `[ INJECT ]` `< BACK`
   - Grid overlays and scan lines suggest surveillance equipment

2. **Chromatic Aberration (State-Driven)**
   - **Stable (>3 min):** Sharp, clean UI. No aberration. System nominal.
   - **Warning (1-3 min):** Subtle RGB split (1-2px offset). Signal degrading.
   - **Critical (<1 min):** Heavy chromatic aberration (3-5px), scanline flicker, CRT noise. System failing.
   - **Static Event:** Full RGB tear, horizontal displacement, white noise wash.

3. **Cyberpunk: Black + Emerald/Orange**
   - Primary palette: Deep black + Emerald Green (stable) + High-Vis Orange (warning/critical)
   - Avoid pink/blue neon clichés
   - "Military leak" feel: utilitarian, not decorative
   - Glow effects are functional (status indicators), not aesthetic flourishes

**Chromatic Aberration Animation (CSS):**
```css
/* Applied to all UI elements, intensity based on signal status */
.chromatic-aberration {
  position: relative;
}

.chromatic-aberration::before,
.chromatic-aberration::after {
  content: attr(data-text);
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

/* Red channel - offset left */
.chromatic-aberration::before {
  color: #FF0040;
  mix-blend-mode: screen;
  transform: translateX(calc(var(--aberration-intensity) * -1px));
  animation: chromatic-flicker 0.1s infinite;
}

/* Blue channel - offset right */
.chromatic-aberration::after {
  color: #0080FF;
  mix-blend-mode: screen;
  transform: translateX(calc(var(--aberration-intensity) * 1px));
  animation: chromatic-flicker 0.1s infinite reverse;
}

/* Intensity levels */
.state-stable { --aberration-intensity: 0; }
.state-warning { --aberration-intensity: 1.5; }
.state-critical { --aberration-intensity: 4; }
```

**Scanline Overlay (CSS):**
```css
.scanlines::after {
  content: '';
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(
    0deg,
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 1px,
    transparent 1px,
    transparent 2px
  );
  pointer-events: none;
  opacity: var(--scanline-opacity);
  animation: scanline-roll 8s linear infinite;
}

.state-stable { --scanline-opacity: 0; }
.state-warning { --scanline-opacity: 0.1; }
.state-critical { --scanline-opacity: 0.3; }
```

**Glitch-In Animation (Modal/Toast):**
```css
@keyframes glitch-in {
  0% { 
    transform: translateX(-10px); 
    opacity: 0;
    filter: hue-rotate(90deg);
  }
  20% { transform: translateX(5px); }
  40% { transform: translateX(-3px); }
  60% { transform: translateX(2px); }
  80% { transform: translateX(-1px); }
  100% { 
    transform: translateX(0); 
    opacity: 1;
    filter: hue-rotate(0deg);
  }
}
```
